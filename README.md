# Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course - Part 2

#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 

forked from: `https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1`

Now it's possible to add new reviews to restaurants. It works with background sync so it can work even when there is no connection.
In restaurant's page also there is a heart button which toggles favorite/unfavorite restaurant

On main page there is one more filter to see only favorites / not favorites. Since filters take up more space now, on mobile screen they are hidden with an expand switch

Used webp images with jpg fallback

Minified css file. Original file alson can be found in folder

### How to run?

 In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

Alternatively you can use extensions for your IDE / Text editor to run it (ie Live Server for VS Code)
